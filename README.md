Source: Kaggle
Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
Target: Species

🔹 Methodology
Data exploration & visualization
Train-test split for supervised learning
Trained a Logistic Regression classifier

🔹 Evaluation
Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix visualization

🔹 Key Learnings
Basics of classification in ML
Importance of feature selection
Model evaluation metrics

2️⃣ Unemployment Analysis in India

🔹 Objective
Analyze unemployment trends in India over time and regions, focusing on COVID-19 impact and seasonal patterns.

🔹 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Unemployment in India
Features: Region, Date, Unemployment Rate (%), Employment, Labour Participation Rate, Area (Rural/Urban)

🔹 Methodology
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Time-series visualization of unemployment trends
Comparison of pre- and post-COVID unemployment
Seasonal and region-wise analysis

🔹 Key Insights

Sharp rise in unemployment during COVID-19 lockdown
Seasonal employment fluctuations observed
Certain states consistently show higher unemployment

🔹 Tools & Libraries
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

3️⃣ Car Price Prediction 

🔹 Objective
Predict used car selling prices based on multiple features using regression models.

🔹 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Used Car Price Prediction
Features: Year, Present Price, Driven Kilometers, Fuel Type, Transmission, Ownership
Target: Selling Price

🔹 Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing
One-hot encoding for categorical variables
Feature selection and train-test split
Trained Linear Regression model
Evaluated performance with R² and RMSE
Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices

🔹 Key Results

R² Score: ~0.84
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): acceptable
Demonstrated strong correlation between features and car price

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
